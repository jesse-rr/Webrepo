<h2 style="text-align: center;">Blackjack (21) - A Card Game</h2>
Welcome to the Blackjack or 21. This is a CLI Java-based implementation of the classic card game where the goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. The game involves dealing cards and making strategic decisions to either take more cards (Hit), keep your current hand (Stand), or other actions like Double Down or Surrender, enjoy! :D
